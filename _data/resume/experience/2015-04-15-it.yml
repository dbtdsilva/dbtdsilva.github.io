description: "an IoT solution to collect data in an agriculture field and send it to a specific server. The solution consisted of configuring several Libelium boards responsible for collecting sensorial data and send it to a Raspberry. That raspberry was equipped with XBee radio to communicate with the Libelium boards and it was also responsible for publishing the received data to a remote server using MQTT protocol. It also included a configuration / image processing of an infrared camera to scan the agriculture field with a drone to collect data from time-to-time.
During this work, a system to display the data was also implemented using AngularJS (front-end) and Django (services).
<br/>Tech Stack: Python, C/C++, OpenCV, LoRa, XBee, Raspberry, Libelium, MQTT, Django, AngularJS"
