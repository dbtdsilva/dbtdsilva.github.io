description: "This work had the aim of integrating libcloudstorage into VLC. The library libcloudstorage provides access to files located in cloud storage services, such as Google Drive or Dropbox. That said, the user is able to access any media directly from cloud services (as long as libcloudstorage supports it) and reproduce it using VLC. Most of the code developed was written in C/C++. 
Google Summer of Code is not considered a job or an internship, it is a 3-month program that brings Open Source organizations closer to university students interested in collaborating.
