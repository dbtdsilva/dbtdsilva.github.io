description: "After I finished high school, I decided to pursue a broad area in electronics. During the first year we had the typical classes that are common across engineering courses, such as physics, maths, algebra, and programming.
In the second year, we started getting more involved into electronics with circuit analysis, electromagnetic fields, telecommunications and computer architecture. Even though I was managing to pass the classes, I noticed that I was enjoying much more software related classes rather than hardware. 
So after the 3rd year in this course, I changed to <a href='http://www.ua.pt/ensino/course/23' target='_blank'>Computer and Telematics Engineering</a>. Even though I had almost the equivalent to the bachelor, I felt it was pointless considering that I had another course in the same department that I really enjoyed."
