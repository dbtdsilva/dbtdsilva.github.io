description: "Changing to this course was definitely one of my best decisions in my path, I deeply enjoyed each of the classes that I had through the entire course.
This course aims to offer a solid training in a wide range of options in the technologies of computing, information and telecommunications which have assumed a dominant role. That wide range of options includes computer archicture, telecommunications, computer vision, data analysis, services, security, distributed systems and so on.
Along with the course, I got invited for some research scholarships which helped even more that knowledge that I was obtaining each year."
