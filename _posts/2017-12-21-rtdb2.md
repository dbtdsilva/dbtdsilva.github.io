This work was the result of my dissertation done in a robotic soccer team, known as CAMBADA. Due to the continuous growth in the area of robotics, there is an increasing need for robots to communicate among them in order to create cooperation scenarios, as for example in robotic soccer. At CAMBADA, a robotic soccer team which actively participates in national and international competitions, there is an internal module responsible for ensuring that robots can easily access information shared between them in a simple and effective way.

This module is known as Real-Time Database (RtDB) and allows the replication of data sent by different robots, ensuring that each robot can easily access information that was read or interpreted by another robot. The model used by RtDB is based entirely on shared memory, with each robot containing the information generated and shared by the others replicated in its instance. This way, the access to the data of a remote robot is efficient. Updating the data stored in the RtDB is done in a transparent manner by an additional process.

_The following image shows how the replication is done in the RtDB by using an additional process and replication areas inside each agent:_

The objective of this dissertation was the conception, development, implementation and validation of a new version of the RtDB, called RtDB2, that would fill some limitations identified in the previous version, and that simultaneously could introduce some new functionalities. One important limitation eliminated by the RtDB2 was the existing imposition of previous knowledge of the memory space that an information item would occupy.  This would force to previously define the size of the data structures to the most unfavorable cases, which would lead to a memory waste and an unnecessary bandwidth usage. Among the new features introduced, there is the potential of using different programming languages to produce and consume the same item of information, the possibility of dynamically introducing new items or the tolerance to small modifications in the definition of an item.

The new solution was duly tested and used in two of the annual competitions of RoboCup (Portuguese Robotics Open in Coimbra, Portugal and RoboCup 2017 in Nagoya, Japan), without any occurrences of problems.
