> "IEEEXtreme is a global challenge in which teams of IEEE Student members—advised and proctored by an IEEE member, and often supported by an IEEE Student Branch—compete in a 24-hour time span against each other to solve a set of programming problems." - _from [http://www.ieee.org/xtreme](http://www.ieee.org/xtreme)_

It is a **24-hour competition** that involves a lot of knowledge. This competition brings maths and programming completely together, most of the challenges that appear during these 24 hours are required to be efficient, otherwise they will not pass all the tests. In my opinion, this is one of the best characteristics in the competition.

I have been participating on it since 2013 and I do not regret once.
