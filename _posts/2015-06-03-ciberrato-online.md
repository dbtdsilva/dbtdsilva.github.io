**CiberRato is a competition that happens every year** organized by the Universidade of Aveiro with the objective of **simulating a real environment for robots**.

This project consisted in a _web platform_ used to make the competition CiberRato **easier** for both the organizer as well as the participants. Besides this, it is possible to **create multiple online competitions with the same environment and conditions as the competition day, instead of it being only one day a year.** It was developed by 6 members.

The objective was to support the user with the possibility of compete using the platform, it means that he will be have to upload or even edit his code on the platform and submit it for the competition. 

This project **was also used to support the CiberRato competition with several features like online competitions, hall of fame, real-time competitions.**
