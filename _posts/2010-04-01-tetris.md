#### Brief Description  

**Source code is available at: [https://github.com/dbtdsilva/tetris-kinect](https://github.com/dbtdsilva/tetris-kinect)**

This project was created to show a **possible use for a [Kinect](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/kinect/)** (in this case, we have used the first version).

To represent a possible use for the Kinect, we have decided to pick up a game that could be played using only one hand. **Tetris** includes only **4 different movements**. 

#### Movements simulated with the Kinect

The screen where the player plays is divided in 6 areas. These areas allow the player to choose the direction in which he wants the piece to go, or just move fast downwards with the hand and the piece will instantly drop to the bottom of the board. The possibility to pause wasn't left behind, so the top right area it includes the possibility to pause the game by pushing towards the Kinect with the hand.

The possible movements are moving right or left, moving down, instantly put the piece to the bottom and rotate in the respective areas when needed.

### Additional features

This tetris version was implemented as a "Time-Attack" style, which means that the player as a fixed time of 2 minutes to make the maximum score.

It also includes an high score board which was used to create some competition.
