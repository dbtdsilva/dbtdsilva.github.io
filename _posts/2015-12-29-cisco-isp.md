This project consisted in simulating a **implementation of an ISP using GNS3**.

**Feel free to check router configurations at [https://github.com/dbtdsilva/isp-network-sim_gns3](https://github.com/dbtdsilva/isp-network-sim_gns3)**

Thus it requires the implementation of more ISP than just one ISP to be able to **simulate all mechanisms and understand them**, like external BGP. Otherwise it would be impossible to test external BGP without connections for another ISP.

This project includes the **implementations of several mechanisms**:
1. Implementation of local VLANs for different types of access and some VLANs end-to-end for security cameras and;
2. External BGP;
3. Private AS;
4. Routing Constraints (such as, traffic routed over a specific ISP or configure the ISP as non-transit);
5. MPLS tunnel for SIP Traffic and VPNs;
6. VoIP SIP configurations (PSTN and forward calls).

_In the following image it is possible to visualize 3 different ISP: ISP L, ISP S, ISP X (the one that the project were supposed to manage)._
