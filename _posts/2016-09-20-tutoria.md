This program was created in the University of Aveiro (UA) to **promote academic and personal success of new students**. Aiming to meet this purpose, the UA has working in this program since 2010, a Mentoring Program (in portuguese, *Programa de Tutoria*).

In this program there is 3 entities, the new students that have recently joined the university, older students (tutors) helping these new students with problems they might have and mentors that are in charge of supervising the tutors. This helps to create an easier and more relaxed interaction with the new students.

I have been working in 2016 as tutor, helping the newcomers.
