This work describes an agent that is able to play the game known as [TORCS](http://torcs.sourceforge.net/) developed for Intelligent and Mobile Robotics at the University of Aveiro. The main objective of the robot is to control a race car in an unknown track. The agent will try to minimize the time that it takes to complete the race. It was considered that the agent always runs alone in the track. 

This work covered several factors like gear selection, pressure on the accelerator or the brakes and direction of the steer. Besides that, it is also taken into account the path that the agent takes to minimize the time to complete the race. The main strategy to output the values according to the give environment input is based on Fuzzy Logic using a library known as [fuzzylite](http://www.fuzzylite.com/). There are also other strategies that were applied in order to decide where the car should stay in the road or how it should unstuck when it happens (e.g., stuck agaisnt a wall).

_The following image shows how the server handles several clients playing in the same race. Besides that, it also has an example of the car vision sensors (bottom right) and a picture of the actually gameplay (top right)_
