The concept of this project is pretty simple. The idea is to **create a game based on the raw functions of OpenGL**. I have decided to pick **Chess** because I enjoy to play it with some friends.

**Feel free to check this project at [https://github.com/dbtdsilva/chess-opengl](https://github.com/dbtdsilva/chess-opengl)**

With this project it was possible to understand computer vision works, how it represents bigger models, light scenes, environments, etc.

This project **implements models that represent the Chess pieces and the board** (also the possible moves). There is also a **conversion of the mouse click to the world**, **lights implementation on the board** to create a more realistic scenario. 

The following image shows the final result of this project.

Moreover, a **skybox was also implemented instead of having a static color** to represent the sky. It is possible to verify that in the following image, **the player is unable to zoom out from the skybox, otherwise he would notice that the world is represented inside a big cube.**
