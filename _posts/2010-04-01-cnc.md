This is a national event, as the name says, **national competitions of science**. This event occurs once in a year during 3 days.

This event includes 12 competitions in several areas, such as, maths, biology, geoscience, physics, chemistry, portuguse, etc.

Those competitions targets **students** that are in the **elementary or high school.**

I have been **helping those students to manage with technical problems** found during the competitions.
