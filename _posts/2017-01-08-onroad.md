This project consisted of detecting and tracking cars from a digital camera placed on the car's front. The main objective of this project was to study what has been used so far in this kind of situations and even try some of them.

Said that the project was divided into 4 parts:
* Data pre-processing
* Detection
* False positives removal
* Tracking

The detailed report can be found in [https://github.com/dbtdsilva/onroad-car-detection-tracking/blob/master/docs/onroad-vehicle-report.pdf](https://github.com/dbtdsilva/onroad-car-detection-tracking/blob/master/docs/onroad-vehicle-report.pdf).

The first phase, pre-processing, consisted into equalizing the histogram to intensify the contrast between frames. 

The second and one of the most important, car detection, was done using Haar Cascades. This method required to obtain data that wanted to be detected and some false data in order to train the classifier.

The false positive removal was done in two steps:
* Cutting the detection in the horizontal and vertical. The vertical cut divided the car into the left and right side. Then we flipped on to the sides and it should have a similar correspondence since the cars are typically symmetrical when comparing their left side with the right one.
* Considering the average of the road color in the last N frames and applying segmentation with that color, it is possible to extract false positives that appear in the air, since the car should appear partially in the road (bottom part of the car).
