**Campus4US is an event** that happens **once a year** at the University of Aveiro. This event has the objective of **showing the university to the newcomers**, such as, places to eat or to study. At the start of the day, it is created several groups of newcomers (randomly selected) where they have the opportunity to know each other. During the day they will **explore the university** that they just joined with the group.

I have participated in 2011, since then I haven't participated again, but it is worth to try at least once. It is always great to help with the integration of the students in the university.

There is a page with a **small description of this program at [http://www.ua.pt/ensino/page/21562](http://www.ua.pt/ensino/page/21562). _Sadly it is only available in portuguese._**
