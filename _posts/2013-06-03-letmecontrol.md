### Description

This was one of the last projects that I have participated while I was in the **electronics course**, the group was composed of 7 elements.

We were required to address a particular _problem_ which consisted of **developing a temperature controller for domestic devices**. This particular device would turn the device on or off according to room temperature and should function for both domestic heaters and coolers. 

This device would have another functionality, common to this type of product, which would allow it to also turn on or off based on a chosen time set by the user.

It was necessary that the device be easy to carry and to work with since it’s destined for a domestic user with poor knowledge of electronic appliances. Considering it’s destined for commercialization, maintaining a competitive price is instrumental.

### Approaches taken to the solution

During an **early stage of the project** we did **some market research** to determine which devices that already exist in the market are able to solve our problem and identified their main features. Based on this research, we established the main goals of our project: **to design a small device (≈0.1x0.05x0.05m), plug-in, with temperature, time and random control and low-priced (under 40€)** in order to gain some competitiveness in the national market. We also considered the possibility of exporting the product.

The development of the solution was implemented progressively, with two initial prototypes being developed before the final product. The first prototype was **based on and Arduino** development board and the second on **PCB-THT with PDIP components**. 

The following image represents the second solution that was implemented in a breadboard. At first it had an Arduino but it has unnecessary costs because we could only use the Atmega328p which is a lot cheaper.

The **final product was implemented on PCB-SMT with SMD components**. Due to lack of time the final solution was only designed and not implemented as you can see in the following image.

We performed a techno-economic analysis of the product and its market implementation and concluded that we were able to meet all proposed goals and that the project is technologically and economically viable.
