**This project consists in creating a DRM (Digital rights management) that controls the user access in order to restrict the usage of copyrighted works. In this case, piracy of digital content.**
This project is made of two main components: **the player and the server.**

The **server** is in charge of controlling the **user access to the protected files**. The **player requests and plays the files** from the server.

In order for the **user to have access to the titles he/she wants**, we also have a **web application** where the user can buy the titles to play later. To reach the goal of this project, we also needed a database that helped manage the user and file related information.

**Feel free to check the source code at [https://github.com/dbtdsilva/security-iecds-drm](https://github.com/dbtdsilva/security-iecds-drm)**

There is available a **report** which describes what was done for this project: **[https://github.com/dbtdsilva/security-iecds-drm/blob/master/Report60337_60340_Final.pdf](https://github.com/dbtdsilva/security-iecds-drm/blob/master/Report60337_60340_Final.pdf)**

_The following image shows an example of what the report contains. In this case, this represents a login diagram with a citizen card verifying a challenge signed with the private key that is stored in that card._
