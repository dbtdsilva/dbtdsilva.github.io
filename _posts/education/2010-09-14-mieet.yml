description: "After I finished high school, I decided to pursue a broad area as electronic, but after some time I have realized that I was wrong and what I really wanted to do was to discover every small detail about computers. So after the 3rd year in this course, I changed to <a href='http://www.ua.pt/ensino/course/23' target='_blank'>Computer and Telematics Engineering</a>."
