                    <p>I guess that's already enough talking in third person about myself.</p>
                    
                    <p>I'm Diogo Silva, a Portuguese student in Computer and Telematics Engineering at the University of Aveiro who is an enthusiastic for technology. Every time that I get some free time, I just make sure to spend that time exploring something new. I think it is important to keep up with the technology.</p>
                    
                    <p>Along with my studies, I have got a research scholarship twice, one in the IEETA (Institute of Electronics and Informatics Engineering of Aveiro) for one year and the other one in ATNoG (Aveiro Telecommunications and Networking Group) inside of Telecommunications Institute for another year. That gave me the chance of being introduced to the researching area in my campus where I could learn a bit more and get some experience. I do not regret once of getting involved in those scholarships, I had the opportunity to interact with professionals of my area and work with them.

                    <p>As you can see, this is my personal page where you can find some information about me, such as, education, experience, my works, contacts, etc. This page was created using a simple framework, Jekyll, that could get the job done without much effort. You can find the source code related with this page in my GitHub (<a href="https://github.com/dbtdsilva/resume-jekyll">github.com/dbtdsilva/resume-jekyll</a>), feel free to explore it and even use it.</p>
